I'm an independent software developer and works as a full time developer based in Bangalore, India. I've been a full-time Cocoa developer since 2011. 

I've been writing articles on https://cocoajuice.wordpress.com.


This repository is all about sample codes for introduction of concepts which I find either difficult to understand or I think will be helpful to others.

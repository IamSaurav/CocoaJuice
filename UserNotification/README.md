Hello, I'm Saurav. I make iOS, watchOS, macOS and tvOS apps in native and Xamarin platform. I've been a full-time Cocoa developer since 2011. 

This repository is all about sample codes for introduction of concepts which I find either difficult to understand or I think will be helpful to others.


Please feel free to contact me for more information about me or my services.
